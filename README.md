# Dracma2048 Hash Algorithm
This algorithm is my most challenging project. I know how difficult it is to develop a hash algorithm, but I use it as my advanced operation project. With Dracma2048, I learn more about cryptography, security, and various other topics.

If you want to help me develop this, please leave your contribution, whether it's code or simply well-explained advice.

However, for obvious reasons, __do not use this algorithm in production environments!!__ This algorithm is a non-professional hobby/project.

Important:

* Iam making a diagram to show the algorithm
* eventually I will improve the algorithm over time, but I will also have stopping periods
